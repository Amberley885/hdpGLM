\usage{
\method{plot}{hdpGLM}(x, terms = NULL, title = NULL, subtitle = NULL,
  true.beta = NULL, ncol = NULL, legend.position = "bottom",
  display.terms = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an object of the class \code{hdpGLM} generted by the function \link{hdpGLM}}

\item{terms}{string vector with the name of covariates to plot. If \code{NULL} (default), all covariates are plotted.}

\item{title}{string, the title of the plot}

\item{subtitle}{string, the subtitle of the plot}

\item{true.beta}{a \code{data.frame} with the true values of the linear coefficients \code{beta} if they are known. The \code{data.frame} must contain a column named \code{j} with the index of the context associated with that particular linear coefficient \code{beta}. It must match the indexes used in the data set for each context. Another column named \code{k} must be provided, indicating the cluster of \code{beta}, and a column named \code{Parameter} with the name of the linear coefficients (\code{beta1}, \code{beta2}, ..., \code{beta_dx}, where \code{dx} is the number of covariates at the individual level, and beta1 is the coefficient of the intercept term). It must contain a column named \code{True} with the true value of the \code{betas}. Finally, the \code{data.frame} must contain columns with the context-level covariates as used in the estimation of the \link{hdpGLM} function (see Details below).}

\item{ncol}{interger, the number of columns in the plot}

\item{legend.position}{one of four options: "bottom" (default), "top", "left", or "right". It indicates the position of the legend}

\item{display.terms}{boolean, if \code{TRUE} (default), the covariate name is displayed in the plot}

\item{...}{Additional arguments accepted are:

           \code{true.beta}: a \code{data.frame} with the true values of the linear coefficients \code{beta} if they are known. The \code{data.frame} must contain a column named \code{j} with the index of the context associated with that particular linear coefficient \code{beta}. It must match the indexes used in the data set for each context. Another column named \code{k} must be provided, indicating the cluster of \code{beta}, and a column named \code{Parameter} with the name of the linear coefficients (\code{beta1}, \code{beta2}, ..., \code{beta_dx}, where \code{dx} is the number of covariates at the individual level, and beta1 is the coefficient of the intercept term). It must contain a column named \code{True} with the true value of the \code{betas}. Finally, the \code{data.frame} must contain columns with the context-level covariates as used in the estimation of the \link{hdpGLM} function (see Details below).

           \code{true.tau}: a \code{data.frame} with four columns. The first must be named \code{dw} and it indicates the index of each context-level covariate, starting with 1 for the intercept term. The second column named \code{dx} must contain the indexes of the individual level covariates, starting with 1 for the intercept term. The third column named \code{Parameter} must be named \code{tau<dw><dx>}, where \code{dw} and \code{dx} must be the actual values displayed in the columns \code{dw} and \code{dx}. Finally, it must have a column named \code{True} with the true value of the parameter.}
